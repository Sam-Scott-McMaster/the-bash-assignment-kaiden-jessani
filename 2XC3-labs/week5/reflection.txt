So far, C has been much different compared to Python and Java. I learned both those languages through lessons and understanding examples provided to us in high school, however with C I feel like I am trying to learn it on-the-fly. One advantage that C provides is the ability to use pointer parameters, as since Java and Python have pointers associated to their variables, one cannot use pointer parameters in those languages. One disadvantage is the readability of C is much worse compared to Python, as Python is meant to be more user-friendly. I personally prefer to use Python because I have the most experience with it, but overtime I can see myself preferring C later on.
