a. The script allows someone to execute a command if they run code and pass through a variable with the same name as a command. 


Script:

#!/bin/bash
./di "ls -l"


b. PREDICTIONS

   A=a stores the letter a in the variable A
   B=1 stores the number 1 in the variable B
   C="$A${B}C" won't work, as C has not been established yet
   D=$B*10 won't work, as the number 1 is stored as a character, not as an integer
   echo "$A $B $C $D" won't run as expected, as some variables won't store.


   Actual Results

   C="$A${B}C" stored "a1C" as the variable C
   D=$B*10 printed 1*10 to stdout
